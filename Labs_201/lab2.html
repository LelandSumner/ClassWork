<H3>CIS 201 Labs: Lab 2<BR><I>Chapter 1 Lab: A time and place for
structure </I>

Java Programs</A>.</I>

<H3>Objectives</H3>
<P>In this lab you will work on</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>finding syntax errors in programs
	using compiler output 
	</P>
	<LI><P>writing structured programs with
	more than one method

<H3>Directions</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P><B>Work with your partner and read
	the handout carefully as you go along. Make sure you EACH try every
	exercise. </B>
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>There are 8 checkpoints 
	<IMG SRC="ManRightArrow.gif" WIDTH=25>
	in this lab. If you need help with any problem, raise your hand.
	Call us over to check you off when you and your partner reach each
	checkpoint. </B>
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>You and your partner each have
	a role. One of you enters things at the keyboard while the other one
	reads. After EACH CHECKPOINT, swap roles with your partner. </B>

<H3>Getting Started 
</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Log into your (or your partner's)
	and open a terminal window. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Change directories so that you are
	in your <TT>201</TT> directory.
	If this directory does not exist, create it
	using the <tt>mkdir</tt> command.
	</P>
	<LI><P>Now copy the lab materials to your account. You will need to
	use the <TT>-r</TT> option on the Unix <TT>cp</TT>
	command in order to copy not only files, but also directories. To
	copy, enter 
	</P>
	<PRE>

	<B>Don't forget the space and the dot </B><FONT SIZE=5><B>.</B></FONT><B>
	at the end of the command.</B> Also, ignore any message indicating
	that you can't copy the <TT>Solution</TT>
	subdirectory. <BR><BR>After running this copy command, do an <TT>ls</TT>;
	you will see a new directory called <TT>Lab02</TT>.
	What you copied was actually a directory, plus all of its contents.
	Everything you need for the lab exercises today is contained in this
	new directory. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Change directories into this new
	subdirectory and list the contents. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Open an editor window by entering the <TT>emacs</TT>
	command in your terminal window.
	</P>
</OL>
<H3>Getting Rid of Syntax Errors</H3>
<OL START=6>
	<LI><P>Open the program file <TT>Buggy.java</TT>,
	using the emacs <tt>File -> Open File...</tt> menu item,
	choosing the file <tt>Buggy.java</tt> from the Emacs <tt>Find file</tt> dialog window,
	and selecting the <tt>Open</tt> button at the bottom of the window.
	If the <tt>Open File...</tt> dialog does not show
	the <tt>Buggy.java</tt> file, you may need
	to navigate to the correct <tt>201/Lab02</tt> subdirectory.
	</p>
	<p>
	Without closing emacs, go back to your terminal window
	and try to compile this program.  There are lots of syntax errors in it.
	Use the compiler's error messages to help you fix all of the
	errors in emacs.
	After you have fixed any errors, save the file (use the Emacs <tt>File -> Save</tt> menu item,
	or use the <tt>Ctrl-x Ctrl-s</tt> key sequence),
	go back to your terminal window, and recompile the program.
	You may need to do this step more than once until you have fixed all of the errors.
	<BR />
	<IMG SRC="ManRightArrow.gif" WIDTH=25><B>1</B>
	Show us this program after you have all the errors fixed and the
	program compiles and runs.

	Compile and run this program. You will notice that it has a bit of
	problem. It doesn't seem to stop. Actually, the program will stop

	The problem with this program is not syntactic. Remember, it did
	compile and run. The problem has to do with the logic in the program
	itself - called <I>logic error</I>. Logic errors are introduced by
	programmers.

	<LI><P>Right now, you and your partner look at <TT>Runaway.java</TT>
	and diagnose the logic error. Draw a diagram showing the calling
